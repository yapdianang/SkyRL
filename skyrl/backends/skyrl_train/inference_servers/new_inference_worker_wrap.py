"""vLLM worker extension for the two weight-sync things an engine cannot do.

Weight transfer itself does not route through here: the receive path is an engine
subclass (``weight_sync/weight_receivers.py``, ``weight_sync/delta/engine.py``,
``weight_sync/sharded_rdt/sharded_rdt_engine.py``) driven over vLLM's native
RLHF routes.

What remains are limits of *dispatch*:

``fetch_weights``
    ``/collective_rpc`` dispatches to worker methods by name and refuses
    callables (``entrypoints/serve/dev/rpc/api_router.py``), and no native route
    can invoke an arbitrary engine method. SkyRL's ``/fetch_weights`` route
    (``vllm_server_actor``) collective-RPCs into this method. It is called
    *before* ``pause_generation`` so the checkpoint-delta download overlaps live
    generation.

the LoRA receive target
    ``lora.sync_mode=memory`` sends a PEFT adapter down the ordinary transport,
    and the receiving engine needs the adapter's name, config and alias map to
    apply it. The native round trip carries only names, dtypes and shapes, so
    the target is armed out of band, one round at a time, through
    ``skyrl_set_lora_receive_target`` (see ``weight_sync/lora_target.py``).

sleep / wake
    ``EngineCore.sleep`` hardcodes ``clear_prefix_cache = level >= 1``
    (``v1/engine/core.py``) with no parameter, and ``CuMemBackend.suspend`` maps
    level to tags as ``("weights",)`` / ``()`` with no way to express "discard
    weights, offload kv_cache". A custom ``SleepModeBackend`` does not help: the
    problem is on the dispatch path, not in the suspend mechanism.

Usage:
    Pass as --worker-extension-cls to vLLM:
